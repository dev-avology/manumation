      <p className="mb-3">It happens all the time: You get a lead. You're excited. You mean to follow up. Then life happens: meetings, deadlines, family, and burnout.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What Is Sales Funnel Automation?</h3>
      <p className="mb-3">Sales funnel automation uses smart tools and workflows to <strong>guide leads from awareness to conversion without manual input</strong>.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Done right, it:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Nurtures prospects with personalized content.</li>
        <li>Follows up based on behavior (Not random timing)</li>
        <li>Answers FAQs and handles objections.</li>
        <li>Books calls, sends offers, and closes sales.</li>
        <li>All while you're asleep, on vacation, or doing deep work.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">It's not magic. It's <strong>Manumation</strong>: strategic automation powered by AI agents and built around your business flow.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Traditional Funnels Aren't Enough Anymore?</h3>
      <p className="mb-3">The classic sales funnel is outdated:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>It's linear.</li>
        <li>It relies heavily on live intervention.</li>
        <li>It breaks down when you're busy.</li>
        <li>It treats everyone the same.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">Today's buyers expect:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Instant responses.</li>
        <li>Personalized experiences.</li>
        <li>Seamless transitions between platforms.</li>
        <li>Follow-up that feels helpful, not pushy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">That's where <strong>Manumation</strong> changes the game.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How Manumation Builds a 24/7 Funnel for You</h3>
      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2 mt-6">Step 1: Capture Smarter</h4>
      <p  className="mb-3">Instead of using one generic form, we:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Create a dynamic lead capture that routes people based on their needs.</li>
        <li>Use quizzes, short surveys, or AI chat to qualify leads instantly.</li>
        <li>Tag and segment leads the moment they enter your system.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">This means your funnel adapts from the start.</p>
      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2 mt-6">Step 2: Follow Up Instantly (Without Sounding Robotic)</h4>
      <p className="mb-3">According to <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-short-life-of-online-sales-leads" target="_blank" className="text-primary-600 underline hover:text-primary-800">Harvard Business Review</a>, businesses that respond within <strong>5 minutes are 100x more likely</strong> to connect with a lead.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">With Manumation:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>AI agents send personalized replies in your voice.</li>
        <li>Email and SMS sequences are triggered based on time, interest, and behavior.</li>
        <li>No one ever gets left waiting.</li>
        <li>And you? You get notified only when it's time to step in.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2 mt-6">Step 3: Nurture With Value</h4>
      <p  className="mb-3">Instead of hoping a lead sticks around, we set up:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>A 7â€“14 day nurture sequence with educational content.</li>
        <li>Re-engagement triggers if a lead goes cold.</li>
        <li>Bonus content, testimonials, and micro-offers that build trust over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">All of this is automated and tracked.</p>
      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2 mt-6">Step 4: Close Without the Chase</h4>
      <p  className="mb-3">Once a lead is warmed up:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Booking links are auto sent.</li>
        <li>Contracts and proposals are preloaded.</li>
        <li>Payment reminders are triggered.</li>
        <li>Clients are moved into onboarding without the back-and-forth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">You go from "Interested" to "Paid" faster and cleaner.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Real-Life Example: $15K Launch Without Live Sales Calls</h3>
    
      <p className="mb-3">A business coach used Manumation to:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Capture leads via a quiz.</li>
        <li>Route warm leads to a video sales page.</li>
        <li>Auto-send contracts and invoices.</li>
        <li>Schedule onboarding calls post-payment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">The result?<br /><strong>$15,000 in course sales in 7 days</strong>, no live webinars, no DMs, no sales team.<br />Just one well-oiled 24/7 funnel.</p>

    <section className="mb-12">
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why It Works: Behavior-Based Personalization</h3>
      <p className="mb-3">Manumation doesn't just send stuff, it listens, adapts, and responds.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">For example:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>If someone clicks on an email about pricing but doesn't buy, we send a follow-up with FAQs.</li>
        <li>If a lead watches 80% of a sales video, we trigger an email with a limited-time bonus.</li>
        <li>If someone fills out your form but doesn't book, we follow up with a low-friction touchpoint.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">That's the power of <strong>real automation</strong>, not guesswork.</p>
