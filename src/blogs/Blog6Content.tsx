      <p className="mb-3">Let's cut straight to it: If your revenue has flatlined or worse, dipped, you're probably missing one (or all) of these three pillars: smart systems, focused humans, and automations that actually work.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">And no, we're not talking about those cobbled-together tools that still require your team to babysit every task. We're talking about <strong>Manumation</strong>, the not-so-secret weapon behind businesses that scale fast without burning out their team or budget.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">In the past six months alone, we've seen small service-based teams 3x their revenue without increasing headcount or working 80-hour weeks. Here's exactly how.</p>

      <img src={b7Image} alt="First: Identify Your Revenue Bottlenecks" className="w-full max-w-5xl mx-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg my-8" />
      <p className="mb-3">Most business owners don't realize their growth ceiling is hiding in plain sight inside chaotic client onboarding, disjointed follow-ups, or outdated SOPs that live in someone's brain (or buried in a random Google Drive folder).</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Sound familiar?</p>
      <p className="mb-3">According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2022/09/19/why-entrepreneurs-should-automate-their-businesses/" target="_blank" className="text-primary-600 underline hover:text-primary-800">Forbes</a>, Here's the truth: Revenue bottlenecks aren't always about sales. They're often caused by inefficiencies in operations, communication delays, and the human need to "Double-check everything."</p>
      <p className="mb-3 font-bold">That's where Manumation comes in.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">We start by mapping your current workflows with a human-first lens, then pair it with the right blend of AI agents and automation tools that free up your brain and your bandwidth.</p>
      <p className="mb-3"><span className="inline-block bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-900/20 px-2 py-1 rounded"><a href="https://manumation.ai" className="text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800">‚û°Ô∏è See how we map your systems</a></span> with our diagnostic tools.</p>

      <img src={b8Image} alt="Next: Plug Revenue Leaks With Purpose-Built Automation" className="w-full max-w-5xl mx-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg my-8" />
      <p className="mb-3">Most automations fail because they were built for tools, not people.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Our framework does it differently. Manumation systems are designed around <strong>how your team works</strong>, not how the software was "Supposed" to be used.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Think of us like a systems architect who understands your business model <strong>and</strong> your marketing brain. We ask questions like:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>What's draining your time daily that AI could handle?</li>
        <li>What parts of your client journey create friction?</li>
        <li>Where are you relying too much on manual effort?</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3 font-bold">Then, we plug those leaks with AI-driven automations that:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Convert leads faster.</li>
        <li>Reduce drop-off in onboarding.</li>
        <li>Nurture clients post-sale (Without the monthly email scramble).</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">Result? A full-stack system that supports explosive growth, not just a few "Cool hacks."</p>

      <p className="mb-3">Here's the kicker: AI doesn't replace your people, it supercharges them.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">We help you turn your team into growth drivers, not just task managers. That means:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Giving your VA the tools to manage 100% of client intake.</li>
        <li>Empowering your strategist with real-time reporting dashboards.</li>
        <li>Letting your marketing assistant launch full email campaigns in 10 minutes</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">You're not just saving time, you're buying back your creativity.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">If you've been feeling stuck at a revenue plateau, chances are your people are spending too much time maintaining and not enough time scaling.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">With Manumation, we help you flip that.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">The Real Secret? Systems That Sell Without <em>You</em></h3>
      <p className="mb-3">The truth is, most founders wait too long to systemize their business. They wait for the "Next hire" or "More time" or "Bigger revenue"... but growth doesn't wait.</p>

      <p className="mb-3">And that's what Manumation delivers:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
