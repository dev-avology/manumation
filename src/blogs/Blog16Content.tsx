      <p className="mb-3">If you've been grinding away in your business but growth feels like it hit a wall, you're not alone. Whether you're a coach juggling too many clients, a creative stuck in service delivery, or a small team buried in admin, stagnant growth is a signal, not a sentence.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">It means your current system has done all it can do.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">And that's where automation, powered by a human-first approach like <a href="https://manumation.ai" target="_blank" className="text-primary-600 underline hover:text-primary-800">Manumation</a>, steps in. It's not about replacing people, it's about unleashing them.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Let's dive into how the right blend of AI agents, business systems, and your creative genius can transform the way you grow.</p>

      <p className="mb-3">Here's the truth: Most businesses don't stall because of bad ideas or lazy founders. They stall because they're too reliant on manual processes that don't scale.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">If your calendar is booked but your bank account isn't showing it...<br />If you're spending more time in your inbox than in your zone of genius...<br />If hiring more people just adds more chaos...</p>
      <p className="mb-3">That's a bottleneck. And it's costing you more than just time.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">63% of small business workers say they perform repetitive, time-consuming tasks that could easily be automated (<a href="https://www.mkpcpa.com/blog/automation-statistics-small-business/" target="_blank" className="text-primary-600 underline hover:text-primary-800">Source: Mkp CPA</a>).</p>
      <p className="mb-3">That's not just frustrating, it's expensive.</p>

      <p className="mb-3"><strong>Manumation</strong> is more than just automation. It's a strategic fusion of:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Human creativity</strong> (That's you).</li>
        <li><strong>AI agents</strong> (Tools that think for you).</li>
        <li><strong>Custom workflows</strong> (Systems that scale with you).</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">Think of it as your new digital operations team, one that never sleeps, makes zero errors, and costs way less than your last hire.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Here's what Manumation can help you do:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Turn manual lead-nurturing into a seamless, automated sequence.</li>
        <li>Route customer service through smart AI without sounding robotic.</li>
        <li>Auto-generate proposals, invoices, or contracts without lifting a finger.</li>
        <li>Predict bottlenecks before they cost you your next launch.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">It's not just about automation. It's about <strong>making you unstoppable</strong>.</p>

      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>You're working weekends just to keep up.</li>
        <li>Your team asks you for everything.</li>
        <li>Leads fall through the cracks.</li>
        <li>You can't take a real vacation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">These aren't hustle badges, they're system failures.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">And while most founders try to "Push through," the smarter ones stop and redesign.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Automation isn't the enemy of freedom. It's the <strong>foundation</strong> of it.</p>

      <img src={b19Image} alt="Real Business Wins from Founders Who Automated" className="w-full max-w-5xl mx-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg my-8" />
      <p className="mb-3">Let's keep it real: automation isn't a magic switch, but for founders who commit to it, the payoff is huge.</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>A creative agency</strong> used Manumation to automate client onboarding and cut admin time by 70%.</li>
        <li><strong>A solopreneur coach</strong> built a lead-gen system that runs 24/7 and books sales calls in her sleep.</li>
        <li><strong>A consultant team</strong> automated reporting and proposal generation, freeing up entire workdays.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">The thread? <strong>Clarity, freedom, and scalable growth.</strong></p>
      <p className="mb-3">Want to see how your own time leaks are sabotaging growth? You don't need to guess, you can measure it.</p>

      <p className="mb-3">Staying "Hands-on" is noble, but scaling demands strategy. Automation helps you <strong>show up where you matter most</strong> and stop being the glue holding everything together.</p>
