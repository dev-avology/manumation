      <p className="mb-3">You didn't start your business to drown in busywork. Yet somehow, you're deep in task overwhelm, patching holes in workflows with duct tape and duct-tired energy.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Sound familiar?</p>
      <p className="mb-3">If you're running a business without a systemized backbone of automation + intelligence, there's a high chance you're leaving 20â€“35% of revenue potential sitting on the table. And here's the kicker: this isn't about working harder, it's about working with your business, not against it.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Let's talk about a strategy that's helping founders like you reclaim time, scale without hiring, and add 35% more to their bottom line: Manumation.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What's Manumation?</h3>
      <img src={b8Image} alt="What's Manumation?" className="w-full max-w-5xl mx-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg my-8" />
      <p className="mb-3">Manumation is a powerful blend of manual brilliance and automation intelligence. It's where human creativity meets AI systems and business process automation.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Think of it as your "Chief Efficiency Officer" that never sleeps. This isn't about replacing your team or creativity, it's about multiplying your effort without multiplying your hours. You bring the vision. Manumation brings the velocity.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Cost of NOT Automating</h3>
      <img src={b9Image} alt="The Cost of NOT Automating" className="w-full max-w-5xl mx-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg my-8" />
      <p className="mb-3">Let's break it down with real numbers.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">If your business earns <strong>$250K/year</strong> and you spend 30% of your time on repeatable, low-impact tasks (Think onboarding emails, follow-ups, lead qualification), that's <strong>$75,000 in lost opportunity</strong> every single year.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">No, we imagine automating those processes while still adding your personality where it counts. That's what Manumation unlocks.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">It's not just about reclaiming time; it's about creating consistency, better client experiences, and more room for innovation.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">According to <a href="https://www.zenefits.com/workest/automation-small-business/" target="_blank" className="text-primary-600 underline hover:text-primary-800">Zenoflo</a>, 66% of small business employees say automation lets them focus on more creative and impactful work. That's not a small thing.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">This Strategy Works in 3 Key Areas</h3>
      <p className="mb-3">Here's how Manumation turns your processes into profit:</p>
      <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-4 mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Automated Lead Nurturing</strong>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
            <li>Qualify leads with AI agents.</li>
            <li>Deliver personalized, pre-written email sequences.</li>
            <li>Book discovery calls automatically.</li>
          </ul>
          <span className="block mt-2">No ghosting. No lag time. Just smooth conversions on autopilot.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Client Onboarding + Delivery</strong>
          <p className="mb-3">Still sending Google Docs and Stripe links one by one? Manumation creates workflows that:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
            <li>Trigger invoices, contracts, and welcome packets.</li>
            <li>Assign tasks to clients or internal team members.</li>
            <li>Notify you only when human input is needed.</li>
          </ul>
          <span className="block mt-2">You'll look more professional and waste zero time babysitting your own business.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Follow-Ups That Don't Drop the Ball</strong>
          <p className="mb-3">Most service providers lose revenue due to inconsistent follow-ups. With Manumation, youâ€™ll have:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
            <li>Smart reminders for upsells or renewals.</li>
            <li>Thank-you sequences that drive referrals.</li>
            <li>Post-project feedback collection.</li>
          </ul>
          <span className="block mt-2">You stay top of mind without doing a thing. And yep, it feels like magic.</span>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <img src={b10Image} alt="Real Talk: Why Founders Delay Automation" className="w-full max-w-5xl mx-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg my-8" />
      <p className="mb-3">Let's name the hesitation:</p>
      <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary-400 pl-4 italic text-secondary-700 dark:text-light-400 mb-3">
        "I don't have time to automate."
      </blockquote>
      <p className="mb-3">The irony? If you're time poor, you can't afford not to.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Building automation doesn't mean disappearing behind dashboards or turning your business into a robot. It means amplifying what works so you can spend your energy on big-move decisions instead of babysitting your inbox.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Another one we hear:      </p>
      <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary-400 pl-4 italic text-secondary-700 dark:text-light-400 mb-3">
        "Automation feels cold."
      </blockquote>
      <p className="mb-3">It doesn't have to. In fact, with AI agents that can reflect your tone and brand voice, you can create a more personal experience than trying to do everything yourself.</p>
