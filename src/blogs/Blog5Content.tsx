    <section className="mb-8">
      <p className="mb-3">According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2022/09/19/why-entrepreneurs-should-automate-their-businesses/" target="_blank" className="text-primary-600 underline hover:text-primary-800">Forbes</a>, Most entrepreneurs didn't start their business to spend their days in spreadsheets, chasing follow-ups, or duct-taping broken systems together.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">You launched because you had a vision: Freedom, impact, and a business that doesn't burn you out.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">But somewhere between onboarding your tenth client and updating your fourth CRM, that vision got buried under busywork.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">So, what if I told you that a 35% revenue increase in just 6 months isn't a pipe dream, it's happening right now for founders who've finally stopped doing everything manually?</p>
      <p className="mb-3">The secret? It's called <strong>Manumation</strong>.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What's Manumation, Anyway?</h3>
      <img src={b6Image} alt="What's Manumation, Anyway?" className="w-full max-w-5xl mx-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg my-8" />
      <p className="mb-3">Think of Manumation as the sweet spot where <strong>human genius meets AI agents and business automation systems</strong>.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">We're not talking about soulless bots or rigid templates. This is about <strong>streamlining operations</strong> without losing your personal touch. Think automated lead nurturing that still feels personal. Or project management that runs itself while you sleep.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">With Manumation, <strong>entrepreneurs reclaim 10+ hours a week</strong>, plug revenue leaks, and create a growth engine that doesn't rely on more hustle.</p>

      <img src={b7Image} alt="Real Results from Real Founders" className="w-full max-w-5xl mx-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg my-8" />
      <p className="mb-3">One of our clients is an online coach with a small but mighty team. We're stuck at $20K/month. After six months of Manumation, she scaled to over $27K/month, without adding new team members.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">That's a <strong>35% increase in revenue</strong>, just by aligning her offers with the right automations and AI agents.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">No new ad spend. No burnout. Just systems that work.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why You're Stalling (Even If You're Growing)</h3>
      <p className="mb-3">If your business is doing "Okay" but it feels like you're treading water, there's a good reason for it:</p>
      <p className="mb-3"><strong>You're growing on <a href="#" className="text-primary-600 underline hover:text-primary-800">manual</a>.</strong></p>
      <p className="mb-3">Manual operations create bottlenecks, especially when you are the system. You're the closer, the <a href="#" className="text-primary-600 underline hover:text-primary-800">onboarder</a>, the ops manager, the everything.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">The result? Time poverty. Decision fatigue. Growth plateaus.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">This is what we call <strong>Founder Drain</strong>, a quiet killer of momentum and morale. And the longer it goes unaddressed, the harder it is to scale.</p>

      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-4 mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Lead Gen Runs in the Background</strong><br />
          <span className="text-base">Set up smart funnels that engage, qualify, and book leads while you focus on delivery.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Onboarding Becomes Hands-Off (and Delightful)</strong><br />
          <span className="text-base">Welcome new clients with automated emails, calendars, and checklists that feel custom because they are.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fulfillment Becomes Efficient and Scalable</strong><br />
          <span className="text-base">Map your workflows once, then let AI agents and automations take over repetitive tasks.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You Finally Get to Think Again</strong><br />
          <span className="text-base">When your calendar isn't full of "Should-dos," you can get back to the big vision stuff.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">Want a visual? We love how Zapier explains the power of business automation in this post. It's not about replacing people; it's about unleashing them.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Still Think You're Not "Big Enough" for Automation?</h3>
      <p className="mb-3">This is the biggest myth we hear from founders:</p>
      <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary-400 pl-4 italic text-secondary-700 dark:text-light-400 mb-3">
        "I'll automate once I hit $100K/month."<br />
        "I'm too early for systems."<br />
        "I just need to push through."
      </blockquote>
      <p className="mb-3">Sound familiar?</p>
      <p className="mb-3"><strong>Here's the truth: Systems are what get you to $100K/month. Not the other way around.</strong></p>
      <p className="mb-3">Even if you're a solo founder, you need support. Manumation is that support on autopilot.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">And if you're managing a small team? Automations don't replace <a href="#" className="text-primary-600 underline hover:text-primary-800">them</a> they <strong>amplify</strong> them. Your VA becomes a team lead. Your ops manager becomes a strategist. Your time becomes yours again.</p>
