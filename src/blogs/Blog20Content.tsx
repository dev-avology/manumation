      <p className="mb-3">If you're pouring hours into your business but still feeling stuck at the same revenue plateau, you're not alone. The truth? <strong>Most business owners hit growth ceilings not because of a lack of effort but because of invisible bottlenecks.</strong> And worse, they spend months (or years) trying to fix the wrong things.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">The good news? Many of these blocks aren't permanent. They're automatable.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">This article breaks down the five most common business growth bottlenecks and how <strong>Manumation</strong>, our strategy-first automation approach, can eliminate them so you can scale with ease, not stress.</p>

      <img src={b1Image} alt="Manual Follow-Ups" className="w-full max-w-5xl mx-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg my-8" />
      <p className="mb-3">You're amazing on sales calls. You know how to close. But let's be honest, how many leads never hear from you again because you forgot to follow up?</p>
      <p className="mb-3">This single gap can cost you thousands in lost opportunities. According to <a href="https://thesaleshunter.com/44-of-sales-reps-give-up-after-one-follow-up/" target="_blank" className="text-primary-600 underline hover:text-primary-800">Brevet</a>, <strong>80% of sales require five follow-ups, yet 44% of reps give up after one.</strong></p>

      <img src={b2Image} alt="Inconsistent Client Onboarding" className="w-full max-w-5xl mx-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg my-8" />
      <p className="mb-3">A chaotic onboarding process doesn't just stress you out, it sets a shaky tone for the entire client experience.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">From collecting intake forms to sending invoices, contracts, and welcome materials, <strong>manual onboarding creates delays, errors, and unhappy clients.</strong></p>
      <h4 className="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why It's a Bottleneck:</h4>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">

        <li>You lose hours every week to redundant admin.</li>
        <li>Your brand experience feels inconsistent.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-3">Let's talk tools.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">If your business uses 7+ different apps that don't talk to each other (Think Calendly, Dubsado, Google Sheets, Notion, Zapier, Mailchimpâ€¦), you're not alone. But that's not a tech stack it's a tech mess.</p>
      <p className="mb-3"><strong>43% of small businesses say their software tools are disconnected</strong>, leading to lost data, dropped tasks, and double work.</p>
      <h4 className="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why It's a Bottleneck:</h4>

        <li>You (or your VA) have to manually move data.</li>
        <li>You're paying for tools you barely use.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Replaces multiple tools with streamlined workflows tailored to your business model.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">You don't need more software. You need synergy.</p>

      <p className="mb-3">You're the visionary. The creative. The face of the brand.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">But when <strong>every decision, approval, and task goes through you</strong>, you become the bottleneck. Growth stalls. Momentum dies. Burnout creeps in.</p>
      <h4 className="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why It's a Bottleneck:</h4>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">

      <h4 className="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">How Manumation Fixes It:</h4>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Delegates low-impact tasks to AI and automation.</li>
        <li>Creates SOPs and workflows that empower your team (or future hires).</li>
        <li>Gives you your time, brainspace, and freedom back.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">This isn't about replacing you it's about freeing you up for what only you can do.</p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4">5. Lack of Visibility (You're Guessing, Not Leading)</h3>
      <p className="mb-3">You can't fix what you can't see. If you're unsure which lead sources convert best, what content drives traffic, or where clients drop off in your funnel you're flying blind.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">This lack of insight slows decisions, wastes resources, and leaves money on the table.</p>
