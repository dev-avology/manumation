      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Let's Get Real: You Didn't Start a Business to Drown in Admin</h3>
      <p className="mb-3">You started your business to create freedom, not to spend your best hours sending follow-up emails, juggling appointment reminders, or updating spreadsheets at 1 AM. Yet here you are, stuck in a cycle of busywork that's draining your energy and capping your growth.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">You're not alone. The average small business owner spends over <strong>15 hours a week</strong> on tasks that could be automated. That's nearly <strong>two full workdays</strong> lost not building your brand, not serving clients, and not living the life you signed up for.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">So what's the fix? It's not just automation. It's <strong>Manumation</strong>.</p>

      <p className="mb-3"><strong>Manumation</strong> is the strategic fusion of <strong>human ingenuity</strong>, <strong>AI agents</strong>, and <strong>automated systems</strong> that transforms how you run your business. It's not just "Set it and forget it" automation; it's a smart, personalized workflow design built around your business goals and bandwidth.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Where traditional automation might save you 10 minutes, Manumation frees up <strong>whole hours</strong> while improving the client experience and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">It's like hiring a digital team that never sleeps and doesn't need micromanaging.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">What Makes Manumation Different from Just "Automation"?</h3>
      <p className="mb-3">You've probably used CRM tools. Maybe you've dabbled in templates or workflows. But if those tools are scattered or not talking to each other, they can become more stressful than helpful.</p>
      <p className="mb-3"><strong>Manumation isn't just about automating it's about orchestrating.</strong></p>
      <p className="mb-3">It's strategy-first, then tech. It's designed around your business and your ideal workday.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">You stay in control of your brand's voice and value, while automation handles the admin work that's been stealing your focus.</p>

        <li>More qualified leads.</li>
        <li>17 hours a week back to focus on coaching.</li>
        <li>And yes, happier clients who felt heard immediately.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">Now imagine what you could do with 16+ hours back in your week.</p>
