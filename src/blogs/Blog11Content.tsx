      <p className="mb-3">If you've ever thought, "There's got to be a better way to run this business," you're not alone. Most small business owners and service providers hit the same wall: Long hours, inconsistent income, and no clear path to scaling without sacrificing sanity.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">But here's the truth: It's not about working harder, it's about automating smarter.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">At <strong>Manumation</strong>, we combine decades of automation expertise with AI agents and human creativity to create systems that save time, money, and brain space. And yes, it's just as powerful as it sounds.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What Happens When You Blend AI, Automation & Human Insight?</h3>
      <p className="mb-3">Let's be real, there's no shortage of automation tools. Zenoflo, Make, ChatGPT, CRMs... you've probably tried a few. But here's what most people miss: Tools alone don't solve chaos. Strategy does.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">That's where Manumation comes in.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Instead of piecing together random apps, we bring decades of automation experience across industries from operations to sales systems, onboarding workflows to content pipelines. We don't just build automations. We build revenue-producing systems.</p>
      <p className="mb-3 font-bold">It's not plug-and-play. It's plug-and-play.</p>

      <img src={b12Image} alt="Real Savings, Real Fast" className="w-full max-w-5xl mx-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg my-8" />
      <p className="mb-3">Imagine automating:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>New client onboarding (No more back-and-forth emails).</li>
        <li>Lead nurturing (Without spamming your list).</li>
        <li>Monthly reporting (Done before you wake up).</li>
        <li>Social media content scheduling (based on what works).</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">You don't need a huge team or fancy software. You just need automations that make sense for your business.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Here's a sneak peek at what we've helped businesses save:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>$85,000/year by eliminating manual admin roles.</li>
        <li>20+ hours/week recovered from repetitive client communications.</li>
        <li>3x growth in offer delivery speed with automated workflows.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">And it's all rooted in something most tech consultants can't offer: Decades of experience making automation work across real-world businesses.</p>

      <p className="mb-3">You may be tempted to go it alone, and we get it. But here's what we see all the time:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>You spend 10+ hours building a funnel... that doesn't convert.</li>
        <li>You automate a client intake form... but leads drop off halfway through.</li>
        <li>You pay for tools you don't even use.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">This isn't a tech problem. It's a systems problem.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">DIY automation often costs more in wasted time, tools, and missed revenue than hiring an expert from the start. Want proof? Just look at this case study on small business automation gone wrong from <a href="https://www.zenefits.com/workest/automation-small-business/" target="_blank" className="text-primary-600 underline hover:text-primary-800">Zenoflo</a>.</p>
