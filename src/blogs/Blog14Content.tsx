      <p className="mb-3">Let's get brutally honest for a minute.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">You didn't start your business to drown in task lists, chase overdue invoices, or be the one who remembers every single thing that keeps the wheels turning. You started this because you had a vision. Freedom. Impact. Maybe even a little fun.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">But somewhere along the way, you became the bottleneck. And now you're running on fumes, juggling it all, and wondering if burnout is part of the entrepreneurial package.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Here's the truth: <strong>Burnout isn't a badge of honor. It's a red flag.</strong> And the breakthrough you need? It starts with automation that works for you, not just some cookie-cutter system or "Growth hack" that adds more tech overwhelm to your plate.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Welcome to Manumation. This is where burnout ends and breakthrough begins.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Why Burnout Is a Systems Problem (Not Just a Mindset One)</h3>

      <p className="mb-3">Yes, mindset matters. But no amount of mindset work can fix broken, manual systems.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">You might be stuck in a loop that looks like this:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>You're doing discovery calls and onboarding manually.</li>
        <li>You've got client follow-ups scattered across emails, voice notes, and random sticky notes.</li>
        <li>You're selling via DMs instead of scalable funnels.</li>
        <li>And worst of all? You're still doing admin work that could easily be done by a bot.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">This isn't just exhausting, it's expensive. As many as 90% of employees have reported feeling burdened with boring, recurring tasks (<a href="https://clockify.me/blog/productivity/automation-statistics/" target="_blank" className="text-primary-600 underline hover:text-primary-800">source: Clockify</a>).</p>

Airtable fatigue. Calendar chaos. Sound familiar? You've probably tried to duct-tape your tech stack together with all the "Top 10 tools for scaling." But instead of freedom, you got friction.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Here's why:</p>
      <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary-500 pl-4 italic mb-3">Most tools aren't designed for your brain. They're made for systems thinkers, not visionaries, creatives, or founder-types like you.</blockquote>

      <p className="mb-3">We blend human strategy with <em>AI agents</em> and <em>lean automation</em> to build systems that feel intuitive, scalable, and... dare we say, kind of magical?</p>
      <p className="mb-3">We don't start with tech. We start with your goals, your bottlenecks, and the business you're building.</p>

      <p className="mb-3">Let's paint the picture.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Breakthrough is:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>A funnel that sells for you 24/7 without needing to go live or be in your DMs.</li>
        <li>Clients onboarded automatically, with zero hand-holding from you.</li>
        <li>Project tasks are getting assigned without you lifting a finger.</li>
        <li>Analytics that show what's working (And what's not) in one clean dashboard.</li>
        <li>Time back on your calendar so you can think like a CEO again.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3 font-bold">This isn't a dream. It's the system we help you build.</p>

      <p className="mb-3">Here's the baby step: You don't have to overhaul your business in one go. Start small. Start smart.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Look for tasks you do more than 3x a week. That's your automation goldmine.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Then ask: Can this be templatized, delegated, or automated?</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Want a shortcut? Manumation does this with you. We help you identify what's worth automating, map your systems, and build the right automations without bloated tech stacks or busywork.</p>
