      <p className="mb-3">What if the bottleneck in your business isn't a lack of effort, but a lack of automation?</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Across 200+ service-based businesses, one thing consistently separated the overwhelmed from the thriving: they stopped duct-taping tools together and started using automation as a growth system, not a tech pile-up.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">That's where Manumation steps in.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Let's break down how real entrepreneurs reclaimed their time, simplified their systems, and scaled sustainably, without hiring a massive team or spending a fortune on tech.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Problem Isn't the Tools. It's the Tool Overload</h3>
      <img src={b13Image} alt="The Problem Isn't the Tools" className="w-full max-w-5xl mx-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg my-8" />
      <p className="mb-3">We've talked to coaches juggling 14+ software subscriptions, consultants managing clients across five platforms, and agency owners paying for tools they haven't logged into in <em>months</em>.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Sound familiar?</p>
      <p className="mb-3">According to a <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/07/stop-buying-software-you-dont-need" target="_blank" className="text-primary-600 underline hover:text-primary-800">Harvard Business Review study</a>, most companies waste 30% of their software budget on tools they don't fully use.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Add in the time cost, and you're looking at thousands of hours lost yearly to poor integration and manual processes.</p>

      <p className="mb-3">Whether it was a solopreneur finally scaling their offer or a boutique team tripling revenue, the story always had three key milestones:</p>
      <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-4 mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>System First, Tool Second</strong>
          <p>They stopped chasing tools and started building intentional systems. With Manumation's framework, the business gets mapped before any automation is applied.</p>
          <p>Example: One branding coach cut client onboarding time from 2 hours to 15 minutes using a simple AI agent and <a href="https://www.zenefits.com/workest/automation-small-business/" target="_blank" className="text-primary-600 underline hover:text-primary-800">Zenoflo</a> connection. It wasn't about fancy tech, it was about removing friction.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AI Agents that Have Time</strong>
          <p>No more "AI for the sake of it." Our automation strategy focuses on smart delegation like an AI that screens leads, pre-qualifies them, and books calls directly to your calendar.</p>
          <p>One client saved 8 hours per week just by automating lead follow-up sequences using a combo of Notion, ChatGPT, and Make.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lean Automation That Grows With You</strong>
          <p>Forget enterprise-level complexity. The most successful automators start small, automating 1â€“2 high-leverage workflows, then build out as they scale.</p>
          <p>With Manumation, 73% of users reported doubling their capacity within the first 60 days.</p>
        </li>
