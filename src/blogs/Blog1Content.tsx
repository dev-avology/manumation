      <p className="mb-3">Let's face it, being a founder often means being everything: CEO, sales rep, social media manager, customer service, project coordinator, and copywriter. You know what needs to be done, but there's just not enough of you to go around.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">But what if you could clone yourself?</p>
      <p className="mb-3">No, not sci-fi style. We're talking about <strong>AI agents</strong>, intelligent digital assistants trained to take repetitive, time-sucking tasks off your plate while still sounding like <em>you</em>. And when used with the strategy-driven framework of <strong>Manumation</strong>, they can become the most valuable (and affordable) team members you'll ever have.</p>

      <img src={b2Image} alt="What are AI agents?" className="w-full max-w-5xl mx-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg my-8" />
      <p className="mb-3">AI agents are not just chatbots. They're <strong>adaptive, task-completing digital tools</strong> that use artificial intelligence to handle complex tasks, writing emails, qualifying leads, scheduling, and even engaging with your audience, without you having to micromanage.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Unlike generic automation, <strong>AI agents learn from your preferences</strong>, can be trained on your tone and brand voice, and adjust their behavior based on inputs.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">According to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-10-11-gartner-says-more-than-80-percent-of-enterprises-will-have-used-generative-ai-apis-or-deployed-generative-ai-enabled-applications-by-2026" target="_blank" className="text-primary-600 underline hover:text-primary-800">Gartner</a>, 80% of enterprise software will include embedded AI by 2026.<br />But entrepreneurs and small business owners don't have to wait. Tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and custom-trained agents are already transforming how lean teams scale.</p>

      <p className="mb-3">Imagine having a trained assistant who:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Automatically responds to FAQs in your DMs or inbox.</li>
        <li>Draft follow-up emails based on conversation history.</li>
        <li>Qualifies and tags leads based on their responses.</li>
        <li>Creates first drafts of blog posts, captions, or proposals.</li>
        <li>Reminds clients about upcoming deadlines or payment dates.</li>
        <li>Routes incoming inquiries to the right service or funnel.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>AI agents take over the work that drains your mental energy, without sacrificing quality.</p>

        <li>Auto-booking calls based on lead stage.</li>
        <li>Personalized follow-up emails.</li>
        <li>Payment and onboarding automation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">The result?<br />A $10K revenue month with just 4 hours of live work per week, no VA, no burnout.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How AI Agents Work Inside Manumation</h3>
      <p className="mb-3">Manumation doesn't just drop an AI agent into your business and wish you luck.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">We:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Map your workflows:</strong> Understand what's draining your time and energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Train your AI:</strong> Feed it your tone, FAQs, offers, and processes.</li>
        <li><strong>Test and refine:</strong> Monitor how it responds and improve over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Connect your stack:</strong> Sync it with your email, CRM, calendar, and more.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So instead of 12 tabs and 5 different tools, your AI agent becomes the hub that makes everything talk and move together.</p>

      <p className="mb-3">The goal isn't to make your business robotic. It's to free you up to spend time on what matters most: Strategy, creativity, service, and rest.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">A further 83% say demonstrating AI skills will help current employees have more job security than those who don't. Workers willing to adapt to technology demands and sharpen up on AI tools may be able to mitigate the impact of these job loss predictions (<a href="https://www.aiprm.com/en-gb/ai-replacing-jobs-statistics/" target="_blank" className="text-primary-600 underline hover:text-primary-800">Source: AIPRM</a>).</p>
