      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Why It Matters: The Hidden Cost of Half-Baked Automation</h3>
      <p className="mb-3">According to a 2023 report from McKinsey, businesses that properly implement intelligent automation see up to <strong>30% improvement in efficiency</strong> and <strong>20% faster growth</strong> compared to those using disconnected tools without a strategy. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2023-generative-ais-breakout-year" target="_blank" className="text-primary-600 underline hover:text-primary-800">Source: McKinsey - The State of AI and Automation in 2023</a></p>
      <p className="mb-3">But here's the catch: Over 70% of automation efforts <strong>fail to deliver full ROI</strong> because they lack alignment with business goals and human workflows.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Manumation fixes this by starting with your <strong>bottlenecks, processes, and goals</strong>, then applying the tech.</p>
