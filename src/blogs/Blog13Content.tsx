      <p className="mb-3">You didn't start your business to work 60-hour weeks and still feel like you're barely keeping up. Yet here you are wearing every hat, juggling a thousand tabs, and wondering if growth means more chaos.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Here's the truth: revenue doesn't scale when you're the bottleneck. But automation? Smart, human-led automation? That's the unlock.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Welcome to the world of smart automation, or as we call it at <a href="https://manumation.ai" target="_blank" className="text-primary-600 underline hover:text-primary-800">Manumation</a>, the future-proof fusion of human creativity + AI agents + business systems. When done right, automation doesn't just buy back your time it builds a 24/7 sales machine that grows with or without you.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Let's break down how it works and why you need it now.</p>
    </section>
    <section className="mb-12">
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">1. What is Smart Automation, and why is "Manumation" different?</h3>
      <p className="mb-3">Smart automation isn't just Zapier zaps and robotic email sequences. It's about aligning your customer journey, team workflows, and sales systems with intelligent, creative tech that replicates your best work without you doing it.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">At Manumation, we mix:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Human intuition (Your brand voice, offers, and genius).</li>
        <li>AI-powered agents (Like automated DMs, lead scoring, and email responders).</li>
        <li>Systemized workflows (SOPs that turn chaos into clockwork).</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">That combo replaces manual labor with machine logic without removing the magic.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">2. The Real Cost of Doing Everything Yourself</h3>
      <img src={b14Image} alt="The Real Cost of Doing Everything Yourself" className="w-full max-w-5xl mx-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg my-8" />
      <p className="mb-3">Let's say you spend:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>10 hours/week onboarding clients.</li>
        <li>7 hours/week writing custom follow-up emails.</li>
        <li>5 hours/week chasing missed leads.</li>
        <li>3 hours/week in unnecessary admin.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">That's 100+ hours/month you're bleeding just keeping things moving.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Now multiply that by your hourly rate.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Then ask: What could you earn if you spent those 100 hours closing deals, creating new offers, or even resting?</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">3. What Can You Automate (Without Sounding Robotic)?</h3>
      <p className="mb-3">Most entrepreneurs worry that automation will feel cold. That's valid unless you design it to mirror how you already show up.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">Here are high-impact areas you can automate with personality:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Lead Qualification</strong> â€“  Auto-segment new leads with a quiz or chatbot.</li>
        <li><strong>DM & Email Follow-Ups</strong> â€“  Personalize sequences based on where someone is in your funnel.</li>
        <li><strong>Client Onboarding</strong> â€“  Auto-send contracts, prep docs, and access links post-payment.</li>
        <li><strong>Proposal Creation</strong> â€“ Use AI to generate custom proposals from templates.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-3">The secret? Create smart workflows that trigger the right message, at the right time, in your tone.</p>
